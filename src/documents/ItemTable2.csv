In days past, tattoos were traditional, but the ever-shifting tides of battle and alliance between those war-like tribes made it difficult to be certain who would be friend or foe in the future.\n\nOne well known tale tells of a chieftain\'s son, married off to a neighboring tribe to seal a hasty alliance. When he brought his new bride to the bedchamber and eagerly removed her dress, he was shocked to discover a picture of his father and the words \""limp-pricked whore monger\"" tattooed across her back. The alliance did not last very long.\n\nSince that time, inks have been popular. Less durable, yes, but also less chance of making a permanent mistake. Through the use of this brush, warpaints can quickly be copied and used again."")","/Game/UI/Textures/Icons/icon_paintbrush.icon_paintbrush","/Script/ConanSandbox.GameItem","None","/Game/Items/GatheringResources/Rock1.Rock1_C","None","10","0","Material","0.000000","0","0","None","None","","0","False","0","0","0","0","0.000000","0.000000","0.960000","0.000000","0.000000","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0.000000","0.000000","0.000000","0.000000","0.000000","2","0.000000","0","0","0","0","Default","0.000000","0.000000","0","0","0","0","0","0","None","None","None","0","0","0","0.000000","0","0.000000","0","0","0","18052","4","1","12001","3","1","0","0","0","48.000000","","","NSLOCTEXT("""", ""ItemTable_53549_ThirdModifier"", ""Ingredient"")","","0","0","0.000000","1","0","None","-1","-1","1.000000","1.000000","False","None","None"

As his thoughts spiral into the past and as he traces that inevitable trajectory backwards he realizes that there was no single point, no decision that brought him to this point. It was an accumulation of decisions across his entire lifespan, building around him like sand in the desert that leaves him living a life of quiet desperation, drowning slowly as the quicksand fills his throat.\n\nAs the realization hits him, he feels a vast sadness, an aching in his soul that he could have been so much more than simply this. A single, crystalline tear seeps from his eye and drips down onto the parchment he is working on, blurring the ink.\n\nResolving to make more of this life, the man stands, pushing aside his parchment, and moving to the door.\n\nWhich bursts open and, before the surprised scribe can even gasp, he is run through by a wild-eyed thief who has crept into the mansion in search of valuables.\n\nThe thief wipes his knife on the dead scholar\'s clothing, and glances around the room. His gaze wanders across the parchment on the table, filled with a list of items and descriptions written in the neat hand of the deceased scholar. He grins, and reaches for the quill.\n\nLater, when the guards find the dead scholar, lying facefirst in a mingled pool of blood and ink, they will be briefly distracted by the bizarre message scratched into the parchment beside the word ladder. It simply reads: \""Something you climb, idiot\"".\n\nThe guards shrug. Nobody really cares about the text anyway."")","/Game/UI/Textures/Icons/icon_ladder.icon_ladder","/Script/ConanSandbox.BuildingItem","/Game/Systems/Building/Placeables/BP_PL_Ladder.BP_PL_Ladder_C","/Game/Items/GatheringResources/Rock1.Rock1_C","None","100","0","BuildingItem","0.000000","0","0","None","None","","0","False","0","0","0","0","0.000000","0.000000","5.000000","0.000000","0.000000","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0.000000","0.000000","0.000000","0.000000","0.000000","2","0.000000","0","0","0","0","Default","0.000000","0.000000","0","0","0","0","0","0","None","None","None","0","0","0","0.000000","0","-1.000000","10011","4","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","30","1","200","54.000000","","","","","0","0","0.000000","65","0","None","-1","-1","1.000000","1.000000","True","None","None"
